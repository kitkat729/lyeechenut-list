My strategy:
I use React and Material-ui to implement the list. I use React because I want to create the list as a component. Internally, the components are built with Material-ui List, ListItem and Card. The list displays 1-column on small screens and 2-column on medium screens and up. I use Axios to handle API data. The Sort component is a separate component that can handle any sortable lists. The main code sends a closure function for each sortable field. I build my first working version using just plan React. I am also building a Redux for a cleaner solution. I build SASS support into the project, however, when developing for Material-ui, all the component styling goes into the js.
 

The Redux version is 80% complete. I wrote all the action creators, reducers, connected the store to the List container and there was data. To complete, I need to wire the data to list, port the code to Redux action and wire the Sort Component to the store.
